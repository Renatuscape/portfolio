# Portfolio Page
The purpose of this project is to organise my various tech projects on one easy-to-browse page. I have chosen to work with React + Vite/TypeScript to refresh my knowledge of these technologies.

## Status
The project is currently in the planning phase.

## Goals
The user-facing part of the page should...
* Be easy to **navigate**
* Provide a quick **overview** of what I do
* Be **visually** pleasing

The code should...
* Be **clean** and **reusable**
* Be well **documented**
* Follow a **plan**
