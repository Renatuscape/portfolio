# Portfolio Page
The purpose of this project is to organise my various tech projects on one easy-to-browse page. I have chosen to work with React + Vite/TypeScript to refresh my knowledge of these technologies.

## Status
The project is currently in the planning phase.

## Goals
The user-facing part of the page should...
* Be easy to **navigate**
* Provide a quick **overview** of what I do
* Be **visually** pleasing

The code should...
* Be **clean** and **reusable**
* Be well **documented**
* Follow a **plan**

## Project Plan
### Step 1: Preliminary Tasks
* ✅ Get a React/TypeScript project live on GitHub Pages
  * I determined that React + Vite is preferable to just React
* ✅ Get a React + Vite/TypeScript project live on GitHub Pages
  * [The project is now live!](https://renatuscape.github.io/portfolio/)
* ✅ Decide what basic content and funcitonality will be included 
  * An 'About' or 'Home' page that will function similarly to a CV
  * Highlights from my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/Renatuscape?tab=repositories)
  * Highlights from my [itch.io page](https://renatuscape.itch.io/)
  * A page for the project plan and progress
* ✅ Set a few long-term goals
  * A search function for my GitHub repositories
  * Display some of my user data using GitHub API
  * A guest book where visitors can leave comments that are stored in a live database
    * MongoDB and backend has been sorted
* ↪️ Finish this project plan
